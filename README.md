# my-first-time-with-neural-nets

This is what my first implementation of a (very basic) neural network for a "real" use case looks like.

It is not optimized, it runs on cpu, but still, the algorithm achieves a decent score vs the hard coded ia (which is nearly perfect) that plays pong against him

It should use rl and all that fancy stuff, but it's my first experience with neural nets and it DESERVE A GOOD PLACE IN MY GITHUB OK

luv
